# Why?

Google Material Design Icons package are awefully heavy fot web development. I needed the iconfont alone as a bower component, and couldn't find one up to date.

This package gets a Makefile to update the whole thing in a single command, so it's easy to be kept up to date. If you notice a change before I do, please create an issue, and I will have no excuse not to update it.

# Update

```
make all
```
